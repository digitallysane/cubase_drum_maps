        "It would be nice to have Cubase show you the correct names when using a particular Montage/MODX drum kit, but you need a drum map file for that. The only other method Cubase provides is to type in all the names by hand. Given that there are 128 different names for most of the drum kits, that would be a pain.\n",

        "The **Data List** PDF has a **Drum Kit Assign List** that shows, for each drum kit, the name of the sound that each assigned note will produce. For example, the **NewMapleCustom Kit**, shows the name **HH Dark Pedal 1-2 St** for note **C0**.\n",
